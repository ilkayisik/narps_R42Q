This repository contains analysis scripts used to preprocess and model the data for Neuroimaging Analysis Replication and Prediction Study (NARPS, https://www.narps.info) in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.


- For preprocessing we used __fmriflows__ (https://github.com/miykael/fmriflows).

- For modeling and statistical analysis we used __nistats__ (https://github.com/nistats/nistats)
